4783091,13-Jan-14,39.72194,-75.52943,"The M/V DOLE CHILE, a refrigerated cargo container ship, experienced a reduction of maneuverability when the vessel was unable to go astern as it was maneuvering to complete her turn in the turning basin of the Christiana River. Prior to getting underway, engineers on the vessel had removed and replaced a damaged distributor shaft and gearing on the auxiliary drive unit (Specifically shown in pictures 4 & 5) with a new shaft and associated gearing. (The damaged parts were not a part of this casualty). Engine tests ahead and astern were completed successfully. The vessel then prepared to get underway from the Port of Wilmington, Berth 5 and performed successful bridge controls and steering gear tests per navigation regulations. The vessel then began maneuvering with tugs away from the berth and out to the turning basin. Once in the basin, the vessel began to complete a turn when the command for astern propulsion was given on the bridge. The vessel did not respond. The vessel, still with tug assist, returned to Berth 5 and investigated the problem. The cause of the vessel failing to respond to commands to go astern turned out to be a misalignment of the new distributor shaft in the auxiliary drive unit. When the Chief Engineer inserted the new distributor shaft, he lined up the position marks as indicated by the manual although these marks did not correspond with the position of the old distributor shaft. This caused the malfunction of the auxiliary unit to change the direction of the main diesel engine. When the Chief Engineer removed the distributor shaft and reset it to the position in which the old distributor shaft was aligned, the auxiliary drive unit functioned properly. At some point in the unit's history, the position of the distributor shaft was altered slightly, perhaps due to metal expansion, contraction or distortion. No one knew specifics of why the position was altered. But the alteration was not communicated to subsequent engineering crew members and thus when a new distributor shaft was put in place according to the manual for the auxiliary drive unit, it was in the wrong position and caused the casualty.","Marine Casualty, Reportable",Informal,Routine,Routine,No,No

While maneuvering at the pilot boarding area, the bridge controls for main engine were activated from all stop position at which time the engine did not respond. After embarkation of the pilot the vessel dropped anchor and the engineering crew isolated the problem to a faulty automatic unloader valve for the air compressor. Repairs were made and the vessel transited to the Breakwater Anchorage as directed by Sector Delaware Bay to await further instructions and USCG/class attendance. Repairs and operational tests conducted at Breakwater Anchorage were verified by vessel's attending classification society surveyor. As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the automatic unloader valve for the air compressor which led to the failure of the main engine to respond to pilothouse orders thus causing a loss of maneuverability. The causative factors include the poor condition of the air compressor's automatic unloader valve (which was leaky), and quite possibly the length of time (2.5years) between published planned maintenance of the air compressor components.","Marine Casualty, Reportable",Informal,Routine,Routine,No,No

During the maneuver he called for half astern bell from slow ahead to help position the vessel in the channel. The vessels main engine attempted to restart sereval times but failed start in reverse. Pilot then successfully anchored the vessel using the assist tug and bow and stern thrusters. The investigation revealed that the #2 and #3 cylinder burst discs had ruptured as designed due to an over pressurization of the two cylinders that occurred while attempting to restart the main engine. The cause of the over pressurization of the #2 and #3 cylinders due to leaking fuel oil injectors. The leaking injectors allowed for fuel to accumulate in the engine cylinders while the engine had stopped.

Thinking there was an urgent need to shut the engine down to prevent further damage based on the alarm, the pilot immediately anchored the vessel at Pea Patch island anchorage and ordered the engine shut down. As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the shutdown of the main engine. Upon further investigation, it was found that the differential pressure sensor/switch was faulty and thus giving the alarm of the subject cylinder. The associated oil flow switch that is controlled by the differential pressure switch was found to be in the correct position and working normally. All associated cylinder and engine components were examined and nothing abnormal was found. Although no loss of maneuverability would have occurred had the alarm been ignored or silenced since the sensor was faulty, it was treated as a marine casualty and reported and dealt with as such by all parties.

The vessel also lost propulsion and began drifting out of the channel. As a result, the port anchor was dropped in order to keep the vessel from going aground. Vessel anchored at Bombay Hook Anchorage within the Delaware River. Crewmembers and attending classification surveyor determined the loss of power and loss of propulsion was caused by the unexpected closure of a quick closing valve on the fuel supply line for the low sulfur marine gas oil daily tank (LSMGO). The valve had been operationally tested on January 28, 2016 in preparation for a Coast Guard Port State Control Examination and not properly reset. The vessel remained at the anchorage until necessary repairs were made and verified. As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the unintended closure of the quick closing valve. As soon as the valve closed it secured fuel to the auxiliary generators and main engine causing that machinery to shut down. The casual factor contributing to this incident includes a lack of verification procedures in place to ensure quick closing valves for fuel supply lines are properly reset following operational testing of the valves.","Marine Casualty, Reportable",Informal,Routine,Routine,No,No

While transiting, the K21 time delay relay located in the emergency generator switchboard compartment on the emergency distribution system failed and triggered the main power transfer breaker to trip. Normally, the time delay ensures that the emergency generator auto-starts with a short delay to ensure that both the main power and the emergency power are not operating simultaneously; however, the emergency generator failed to auto start and the crew had to start it manually. Since the generator did not start, emergency power was not provided to the steering, main engine digital governor and bow thrusters causing a loss of power, steering and propulsion. The Captain then ordered the emergency lowering of the starboard anchor. While lowering the anchor the vessel briefly touched bottom. Once anchored the crew was able to manually start the emergency generator and determined that the k21 time relay failed.
